# Parallel Sorting Algorithms

This project implements and compares sequential and parallel sorting algorithms in Java using Java Swing. It aims to analyze the performance of five sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort) on both integer and double arrays.

## Features

- Generate random integer and double arrays for testing
- Measure execution time of sorting algorithms for different array sizes
- Compare sequential and parallel execution modes
- Determine the fastest sorting algorithm for a given array type and size

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/parallel-sorting.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Build the project and ensure all dependencies are resolved.
4. Run the main class `MainApp` to launch the application.
5. Use the GUI to select array size, data type, and sorting algorithm options.
6. View the execution time results and compare performance.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Java Swing library
